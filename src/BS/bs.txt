Sorted Array:

Classic binary search to find a target in a sorted array.
Rotated Sorted Array:
Binary search is modified to handle a sorted array that has been rotated.


Finding First/Last Occurrence:
Binary search to find the first or last occurrence of a target in a sorted array with duplicates.
Search in a Range:

Binary search to find elements within a specific range in a sorted array.
Finding Peak Element:

Binary search for a peak element in an array (where an element is greater than its neighbors).
Finding Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array:

Find the smallest element in a rotated sorted array.
Minimizing Problems:

Using binary search to minimize or maximize a function (e.g., finding the smallest/largest value satisfying a condition).
Square Root/Root Finding:

Binary search can be used to find square roots or nth roots of a number.
Median of Two Sorted Arrays:

Binary search to find the median of two sorted arrays.
Search in a Monotonic Function:

Binary search over a function that is strictly increasing or decreasing.
Search in a Nearly Sorted Array:

Binary search in an array where elements are not in perfect order but close to sorted.
Ceiling/Floor in a Sorted Array:

Find the smallest/largest element greater/less than or equal to the target.
Finding Missing Element:

Binary search to find a missing element in a sequence (like in arithmetic progression or in a nearly sorted array).
