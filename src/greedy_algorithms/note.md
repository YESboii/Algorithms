## Greedy Algorithms
A **greedy algorithm** is an approach to solving optimization problems by making the best possible 
choice at each step with the hope that this will lead to an optimal global solution.
The key idea is to solve each sub-problem by selecting the local optimum(greedy choice), 
aiming for it to eventually lead to a global optimum.

### What type of problems are solvable using greedy:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a series of 
locally optimal (greedy) choices. This means that at each step, we can make a decision that seems the best 
at that moment, and it will lead to the global optimum.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems,
and an optimal solution to the entire problem contains optimal solutions to these sub-problems. In other words,
solving each smaller piece optimally will contribute to solving the overall problem optimally.
