1. Monotonic Stack
Definition: A monotonic stack is a stack that maintains its elements in a monotonically increasing or decreasing order.

Monotonic Increasing Stack: The top of the stack always contains the smallest element.
 When you push an element onto the stack, you remove all elements from the top of the stack that are
  greater than the new element. This ensures that all elements in the stack are in increasing order
   from the bottom to the top.

Monotonic Decreasing Stack: The top of the stack always contains the largest element.
 When you push an element onto the stack, you remove all elements from the top of the stack that are
  smaller than the new element. This keeps the stack in decreasing order.

Intuition: Monotonic stacks are used when you need to
 efficiently find the next greater or smaller element for each element in an array.
  The idea is that as you iterate through the array, you maintain a stack of indices where the
  values at those indices are either consistently increasing or decreasing.

Common Problems:

Next Greater Element
Next Smaller Element
Largest Rectangle in Histogram
Stock Span Problem





2. Monotonic Queue
Definition: A monotonic queue is a queue that maintains its elements in a monotonically
increasing or decreasing order, similar to a monotonic stack.

Monotonic Increasing Queue: The front of the queue always contains the smallest element.
Monotonic Decreasing Queue: The front of the queue always contains the largest element.
Intuition: Monotonic queues are used primarily in sliding window problems where you need
 to keep track of the maximum or minimum element in the current window/range. The queue maintains elements
  in a way that allows quick access to the maximum or minimum value, ensuring that as elements enter
   and exit the window, the maximum or minimum is always accessible.

Common Problems:

Sliding Window Maximum
Sliding Window Minimum
Maximum in a Range Query
